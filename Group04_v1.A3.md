## API description

This API takes a location in coordinates and a radius around that location, and returns the most popular 7Eleven in that radius as well as the number of slurpees they sold that year. This allows customers to find a 7Eleven branch near to them and decide which one to visit based on other customer’s preferences. It can also be used by management teams to check on a location’s performance.
